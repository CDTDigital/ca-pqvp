# HOWTO Get up and running quickly

## Platform Support

We have tested against:
* Mac OS X 11.6
* Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS

## Installation

There are 2 pre-requisites for getting the application up and running.

1. NodeJS.  We have tested against version 6.3.1.  We recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.markdown) to be ensure the correct version of Node/NPM are being used, especially when swithching between projects.
2. Docker.  We have tested against version 1.13.1.

After installing both of these, the remainder of the setup can be done by running a few scripts.

1. `npm install`.  Install all of the Node packages that the application & it's build process are dependent on.
2. `docker swarm init`.  Initialize a Docker swarm
3. `npm run docker-db-build`.  Create a container to run the database in
4. `npm run docker-dev-start`.  Launch the container for the DB.
5  (wait ~30 seconds, it takes a moment for the DB server to start up.  navigate to http://localhost:7474 to check if it's ready)
6. `npm run docker-dev-init`.  Connects to the DB and changes the default *local development* password
7. `npm run docker-db-refresh`.  Loads a bunch of CSV files with sample/test data into the database
8. `npm start`.  Builds and launches the web app on http://localhost:8080

After doing this the first time, ongoing development is much simpler.

* `npm run docker-dev-start` after rebooting to get the DB up and running again
* `npm docker-db-refresh` if any of the CSVs with sample data have been updated
* `npm start` to start the web app

Note that these instructions are for local development.  On the CI server, slightly different steps are followed to use a non-default password for the DB and to containerize the web app.

* [i18next](http://i18next.com/) - The localization framework, configuration files can be found in `config/i18next.config.js`. (TODO: having trouble tracking down the v1 release date for this)

## Setup

### NodeJS
Preferably, install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or alternatively install the correct version
of NodeJS specified in `.nvmrc`. Once nvm is installed:

```
nvm install && nvm use
```

This will install and link the correct version of NodeJS locally for 
the project. You should always ensure you are running the correct 
version when working on the project.

### Docker
The production stack is hosted entirely within docker containers.
Although not essential for development, it's preferable to launch the database server using the included docker image.
With this approach, it is not necessary to install the [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database on the host machine.

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) for your platform. 
Once docker is installed, run a one-time command to initialize a [swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/):

```
docker swarm init
```

This will prepare docker for subsequent stack deployment. 
For development and testing, the database docker image needs to be running. It can be started (deployed to a stack) and stopped (stack removed) with npm scripts:

```
npm run docker-dev-start
npm run docker-dev-stop
```

The image does not need to be restarted for each build.

# Running for development

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the express server that will watch for changes and rebuild
as necessary. This has sever some core features:

* Host statically compiled from "dist" directory (see `Prebuild statically compiled files`)
* Host dynamically compiled files on-demand from webpack (disabled if only running `npm install --production`)
* Host RAML NodeJS validation + mock server with user defined API hooks
* Watch client source files with webpack hot module support and force reload fallback
* Watch server source files with server restart via nodemon

# Running for production

## Prebuild statically compiled files

```
npm install
npm run build
```

This will compile all files to the `dist` directory optimized for production. You could now deploy 
the contents of this application to run on a remote server, or use the commands below to 
use the built-in express server to host your production application.

## Run the application

```
npm install --production
node server
```

This will install the minimal number of dependencies to run the 
express app and start the server. This means that webstart can act as a fully functional
stand-alone web server for your application, using the same server you use for 
development purposes but its now targeting precompiled client assets optimized 
for production use.

All watch and dynamic on-demand compilation features are disabled in this mode, but all
other functionality remains just like running for development.

# Testing the App

```
npm install
npm test
```

This will ensure the dependencies are clean and up-to-date, then run 
the tests including Karma, Istanbul, ESLint and Protractor. All reports are output
to the `reports` directory.

Alternatively you can watch for
changes and re-run all tests when changes occur and open up the results
in a browser:

```
npm run test-watch
```

When having trouble with unit tests, you can attach a debugger to karma.
Start the karma server directly:

```
npm run karma-watch
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:9876/debug.html, open browser
dev tools, and set breakpoints.  The browser refresh button will cause tests
to re-run and breakpoints to trigger.

# Documenting the Project

```
npm install
npm run docs
```

This task will generate all documentation to the `docs` directory. All
the source script files will be parsed via ESDoc and all RAML files 
in `raml/*.raml` will create API docs.

# Generating Swagger

```
npm run raml2swagger
```

This task will process the /raml/api.v1.raml and convert it to /swagger/api.v1.yaml.

This task should be run whenever RAML files are modified.

Read more about this in [/swagger/README.md](swagger/README.md)
